## ER Diagram
This repository contains the ER Diagram for the given raw data structure. The diagram illustrates the relationships between fact and hierarchy tables.

## Schema Inference
To create the ER Diagram, I analyzed column names and relationships between tables based on primary and foreign key constraints. The hierarchy tables provide dimension data, while fact tables store transactional data.

## Steps Completed
1. Created an ER Diagram to represent the raw data structure.
2. Identified relationships between fact and hierarchy tables.
3. Uploaded the ER Diagram image to this repository.

## Next Steps
- Build a data pipeline to load raw data into a data warehouse.
- Implement data validation checks and foreign key constraints.
- Normalize hierarchy tables and create fact-dimension relationships.
- Create a materialized view for weekly sales aggregation.
- Implement incremental processing for partial data loads.
